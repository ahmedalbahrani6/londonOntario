                      Climate factors influencing London:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Latitude: Becasue of its higher latitude, London experiences seasonal changes in daylight hours.</li>
                            <li>Ocean currents: While not directly coastal, the Great Lakes affect local weather patterns, having an influenece on temperature and precipitation.</li>
                            <li>Winds: In london they have very strong winds which impact temperature and moisture levels, affecting weather conditions throughout the year.</li>
                            <li>Elevation: Even though its not that high,the  elevation influences its temperature and precipitation patterns.</li>
                            <li>Releif: Surrounding mountains are often changing microclimates within London.</li>
                            <li>Nearness to water: Because of how close London is to the great lakes, its precipitation is often affected. In fact, London is less than an hour drive to 2 of teh great lakes!</li>
                        </ul>
                        All of these factors collectively affect London's cliamte. This allows London to be characterized as a city with an incredible variety in its climate.
